The .R file contains a script based on the book "Machine Learning: A Statistical Approach" by Rafael Izbicki and Tiago Mendon√ßa dos Santos. 
In this script, you can load an image and apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique for image compression and reconstruction. 
Each color channel is treated as a matrix that makes up the original image. 
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is applied to each of these matrices, and finally, the original image is reconstructed based on the predefined number of components.
